uBO blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, etc. through the following lists of filters, enabled by default:\n\n- EasyList (ads)\n- EasyPrivacy (tracking)\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list (ads and tracking)\n- Online Malicious URL Blocklist\n- uBO's own lists\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- EasyList Cookie\n- Fanboy Annoyances\n- AdGuard Annoyances\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- And many others\n\nAdditionally, you can point-and-click to block JavaScript locally or globally, create your own global or local rules to override entries from filter lists, and many more advanced features.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working

It intercepts traffic, finds supported resources locally, and injects them into the environment. All of this happens automatically, so no prior configuration is required.\n\nDifferences between LocalCDN and Decentraleyes\nLocalCDN contains a big collection of frameworks and useful functions.\n\n    New: Sync extension settings with Firefox Sync or own server\n    Includes Rocket Loader, Findify, Vue.js, page.js, lozad, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Google Material Icons, React, Vue, Chart.js and much more. The list will be continuously updated.\n    Includes Font Awesome in different version (v3.x, v4.x, v5.x, v6.x)\n    Prepared rules for uBlock Origin/uMatrix/AdGuard and notifications if rule changes are necessary\n    Removes integrity/crossorigin attributes to replace more frameworks\n\nAdds protection from\n\n    Font Awesome (3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)\n    jQuery up to 3.6.0\n    Bootstrap CSS (Delivered by StackPath, NetDNA and MaxCDN)\n    Bootstrap JavaScript (Delivered by StackPath, NetDNA and MaxCDN)\n    MathJax\n    AngularJS, AngularJS-Animate, AngularJS-Sanitize, AngularJS-Cookies and AngularJS-Touch\n    ...and more (>200 different frameworks in various versions in total!)\n\nSource code\nhttps://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN\n\nWould you like to see other CDN or versions (e.g. jQuery or Bootstrap) integrated? Feel free to open an issue or pull request.\n\nDonations are possible. The possibilities for donations can be displayed in the extension. (Reduces traffic and prevents your IP from being listed in the server logs. Therefore a small offline help page is also integrated.)\n\nFor clarification: This extension doesn't create an external connection by itself. LocalCDN contains these frameworks/libraries in add-on storage. This is the reason why the size of LocalCDN is 17 MB. There is also a donation page and a short FAQ page inside the extension. There are only external connections in the form of hyperlinks that the user must actively click on. This includes, for example, the test page or the translation platform \"Weblate\". All links are marked.\n\n---\n\nThis add-on is a fork of https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes","weeklyDownloads":563,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"nobody","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15698979/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/271/271246.png?modified=1657374986","width":350,"height":281,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/271/271246.jpg?modified=1657374986","thumbnailWidth":350,"thumbnailHeight":281,"caption":"Clean website without 3rd party scripts (LocalCDN: enabled.
